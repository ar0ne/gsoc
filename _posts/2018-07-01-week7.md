##  What have you achieved in the last week?

At this week, I fixed my PRs according to comments of reviewers. And I believe we could merge them now.
And also I've started work on the new Module Details screen. Add module's details, navigation between dependencies and etc.

## What are you currently working on?

Currently, I'm still polishing UI/UX and going to open PR really soon:)

##  What problems are you currently facing?

Trying to work with @theflash98 on issue (https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3402) and figure out other problems with newly implemented screens.
