##  What have you achieved in the last week?

This week I've updated my PR [#3426](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3426), added more useful features and ideas from [#3400](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3400).
Additionaly, we merged a bunch of PRs from the previous week:D

At the moment, ModuleDetails screen looks like this:

There are still few moments that I need to resolve several things (images, better UI/UX) and then we could review/merge it.

## What are you currently working on?

Finishing ModuleDetails screen and other issues from PRs.

##  What problems are you currently facing?

Nothing.

##  Is anything blocking you from making progress?
