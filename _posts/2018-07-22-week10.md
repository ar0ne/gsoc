##  What have you achieved in the last week?

![week10](images/week10.png)

I've finished my work on ModuleDetails screen and tweaks for UIList.
Needs a review and feedback, and if it's fine and we don't have more ideas to add, then probably we'll merge it in the next few days.

## What are you currently working on?

My next goal is to add new UI for FlexibleConfigs. Which would allows us to tune published variables and manage them.

##  What problems are you currently facing?

Nothing.

##  Is anything blocking you from making progress?

Nothing.
