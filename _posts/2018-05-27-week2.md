## What have you achieved in the last week?

**Cervator** and **rzats** reviewed my PR, so I did some changes, some refactoring, add comments, etc.

Also I've tried few ideas how to improve UI experience.

Some of them are pretty discussable. So, I'm waiting for feedback and maybe fresh advices.

Additionally, I added few unit tests and changed default preview image.

## What are you currently working on?

I'm going to start work on new screen "Details".

Also I'm waiting for final review of my PR at least from major part of my mentors.

Probably I'll make last changes after final review and then we could merge the code.

## What problems are you currently facing?

I realized that I can't write good unit tests and cover all classes. Mostly for UI-screen classes.

Unfortunately, I can't do it now, maybe later I'll open additional small PR just to finish that item.

I have really tight deadline and I can't waste time for it now :/

## Is anything blocking you from making progress?

PR needs final review and comments from community.
