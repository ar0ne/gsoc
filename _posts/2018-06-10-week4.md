## What have you achieved in the last week?

I've fixed few defects from my last PR and we already merged the code.
Also I've finished my work on new GameDetailsScreen and prepared PR for merge as well.

## What are you currently working on?

For the next week my targets are:

* start work on "dependency manager" widget
* figure out standard for including logos / screenshots in GitHub repositories

## What problems are you currently facing?

At present we don't have ability to hightlight active buttons/tabs in UITabBox widget.
I've created an [issue #3384](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3384) and put down it to my backlog for now.
Gonna improve it later and update GameDetailsScreen.

## Is anything blocking you from making progress?
