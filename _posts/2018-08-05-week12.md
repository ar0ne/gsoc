##  What have you achieved in the last week?

This week I decided to polish UI classes, improve and optimize my code from previous months.
Decided finish all ideas that were in my head and tried to close as much as possible from [issue #3400](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3400).
And I've redesigned GameDetails screen.

## What are you currently working on?

Playing with last Omega build (978) and testing new features:)

##  What problems are you currently facing?

When my last PRs will be merged I'll proceed work on FCs, but looks like for now those tasks are out of scope of gsoc.

##  Is anything blocking you from making progress?

Nothing.
