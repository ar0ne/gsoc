First week gone so fast:D

![Week1](images/week1.png)

## What have you achieved in the last week?

First of all, first week I've spent working on UI updates for SelectGameScreen.

Secondly, I added preview for saved game world. If we don't have it yet, it'll load default image.

Now we capture this preview image when user decides to exit and save it to `/saves` folder as a "preview.jpg" file.

Additionally, I added short description with information from GameManifest: main world generator and list of modules.

## What are you currently working on?

As you may see, my idea was to use ScrollableArea and ColumnLayout for short description box. That's not good!

In this case we have a big empty area under the "Modules" label. And it looks ugly:(

So, next week I'll proceed work on the UI. Also I'm waiting for feedback for my PR.

Finally, I didn't cover my changes by unit tests yet.
