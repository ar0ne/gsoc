## Final Product

This summer I worked on improving user experience, upgrading existing UI/UX, and adding new useful features to the game.
I’ve implemented several new screens which provide descriptive information about saved games, game modules and other in-game entities. Also I tweaked some existing UI widgets and added new (slideshow, "open-in-browser"). Moreover I extended saved games by association to them previews (screenshots) of in-game process.  Apart of that I’ve fixed numerous small issues that I met during the work.
In other words, all my activities were aimed to help users enjoy the game and have fun of managing it.

Some screenshots of new game menus:

## What’s next? / What’s left?

A bunch of new screens were introduced as part of GSoC by folks for their projects this summer.
They haven't fully united and polished yet and might have potential conflicts.
But when it get ready, I'd happy to make final clean up.
Some of ideas described [here](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3400).

Additionally, I still want to contribute to FlexibleConfigs topic.
It is really huge and interesting project, unfortunately, it has been incorrectly estimated and gone out of scope of the summer.

## Conclusions

I’d like to say thank you to my mentors and community for opportunity to work on this project during this summer. It was really interesting and I have learnt a lot. Thanks so much for reviewing the code, giving suggestions and ideas, etc. I can't do it without you.
I also want to thank Google for running the program and helping open source communities like Terasology make awesome things, learn and develop.
