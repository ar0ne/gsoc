##  What have you achieved in the last week?

![Week3](images/week3.png)

I've started work on new GameDetailsScreen. At present, it still needs some polishing and after that I'm going to open PR.
At the moment you could see all details from game manifest, e.g. active modules, their descriptions, biomes, worlds, etc.

Also, recently we found few small issues regarding my previous PR for SelectGameScreen and preview images.
I've fixed them and open PR [#3380](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3380), hope we will merge them during this week.

## What are you currently working on?

Polishing UI and refactoring code of new GameDetailsScreen.

##  What problems are you currently facing?

Nothing special, just trying to create screen which will be useful as much as possible, and have a good look.

##  Is anything blocking you from making progress?

Nope.
