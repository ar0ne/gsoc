##  What have you achieved in the last week?

This week I've implemented a bunch of useful features from backlog and opened PRs. I refactored selection screens, also add support of Up&Down keys to UIList.
Additionally, now we can highlight buttons, e.g. active tab of UITabBox widget. And few more cool updates of UI:)

## What are you currently working on?

Still developing ModuleDetails screen. Unfortunately, current version is still quite draft and I need extra time to finish all my ideas.

##  What problems are you currently facing?

Nothing special.

##  Is anything blocking you from making progress?

Nothing.
