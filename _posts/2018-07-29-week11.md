##  What have you achieved in the last week?

I've closed several tasks from backlog and gonna finish more.
After small fixes/improvements my current PRs will be merged.

## What are you currently working on?

Trying to fix old ideas and items from this issue [#3400](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3400).
Also still playing with FlexibleConfigs and trying to figure out how can I help with this issue.

##  What problems are you currently facing?

Honestly, FC looks complicated than I expected. But I still think that some Proof-of-Concept from me might be useful.

##  Is anything blocking you from making progress?

Nothing.
