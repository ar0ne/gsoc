##  What have you achieved in the last week?

During the last week I was cleaning up code and user's interfaces. Fixed some issues from backlog and opened few PRs.

## What are you currently working on?

I still have few unfinished PRs, and I'd like to close them firstly. After that, I'd like to start work on new widget for linking to Github or whatever, something like "Open in Browser".
And I gonna finish work on UIImageSlideshow widget (don't have PR yet).

##  What problems are you currently facing?

Nothing special.

##  Is anything blocking you from making progress?

Nothing.
